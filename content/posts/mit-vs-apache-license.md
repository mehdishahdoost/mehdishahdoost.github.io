[MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit/) is a more permissive license than [Apache 2.0](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0/). Basically,
you can do whatever you want with MIT-licensed software, provided you add a 
copy of the original MIT license and copyright notice to it.
Apache is stricter because it requires you to list all the
modifications you make to the original software.

### Key differences

*  The Apache 2.0 license text is much more thorough and contains more legal terminology than the MIT license. 

* The MIT license aims to be the most simple and straightforward open source license for developers to distribute their software under.

*  the Apache license requires developers to disclose any major changes they make to the original source code.
