Every Hitech company has a set of guiding principles for creating its goods, but sometimes it might be hard to find these philosophies 
if you don't work for that company. Github is really different because you can be able to quickly become 
comfortable with the GitHub design philosophy through an API request.

> curl https://api.github.com/zen

* Half measures are as bad as nothing at all.
* It's not fully shipped until it's fast.
* Keep it logically awesome.

Let's explore other philosophies just by API calls...
