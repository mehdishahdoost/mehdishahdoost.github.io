<p>If you use the aforementioned curl command repeatedly, you will receive one philosophy. for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-blocking is better than blocking.</li>
<li>Half measures are as bad as nothing at all.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not fully shipped until it&rsquo;s fast.</li>
<li>Keep it logically awesome.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore other philosophies just by API calls&hellip;</p>
